## Project Overview

This is a SliDev presentation documenting an R&D experiment conducted at SuperTokens exploring web components integration. The project consists of:

1. **Presentation Layer**: A SliDev-based presentation with 25+ slides covering the experiment
2. **Implementation Layer**: A solid-web-components project demonstrating practical web component implementations
3. **Demo Layer**: Multiple HTML demos and a React integration example

## Project Goal

Document and present findings from an R&D experiment at SuperTokens that explored using web components as a solution for framework-agnostic UI component integration, specifically addressing challenges with SuperTokens integration across different frontend frameworks.

## Key Features

- **Educational Presentation**: Comprehensive slide deck covering web components fundamentals, problems encountered, and solutions developed
- **Live Demos**: Interactive HTML demonstrations showing web component capabilities (basic usage, props/slots, event handling, internal state, signals interaction)
- **React Integration**: Practical example of integrating web components within a React application
- **Real-world Context**: Grounded in actual SuperTokens integration challenges and solutions

## Overall Architecture

- **presentation/**: SliDev presentation with markdown-based slides, custom styling, and embedded demos
- **solid-web-components/**: Core web component implementations built with SolidJS
- **demos/**: Standalone HTML demonstrations and React integration examples
- **Multi-format Output**: Supports both development preview and production builds for deployment

The presentation follows a narrative structure from problem identification through technical exploration to practical implementation and lessons learned.
