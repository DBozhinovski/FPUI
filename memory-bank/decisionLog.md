## Decision

**Memory Bank Implementation for Presentation Project**

## Rationale

The project involves a complex presentation with multiple technical components (SliDev presentation, web component implementations, demos, React integration). A memory bank will help track context across different aspects of the project and maintain continuity when working on feedback integration.

## Implementation Details

- Created comprehensive product context covering presentation structure and goals
- Established active context tracking for current focus and open questions
- Set up progress tracking for task management
- Prepared decision logging for technical and presentation decisions

## Decision

**SliDev + Web Components Architecture Analysis Approach**

## Rationale

The project combines presentation layer (SliDev) with practical implementation (solid-web-components), requiring understanding of both narrative structure and technical implementation before addressing feedback.

## Implementation Details

- Prioritize understanding presentation narrative flow
- Analyze technical implementation in solid-web-components
- Review demo implementations for practical context
- Prepare comprehensive understanding before feedback integration

## Decision

**Content Structure Improvements Based on Feedback**

## Rationale

The feedback identified several areas where the presentation's content structure could be enhanced for better clarity and impact:

1. **Call-to-Action Enhancement**: Current "Thank you!" slide has links but uses shortened URLs that aren't descriptive
2. **Framework vs Web Components Distinction**: Currently buried as one bullet point in problems slide, needs dedicated treatment
3. **Problem Statement Clarity**: Introduction could better frame the core challenge SuperTokens faces
4. **Shadow DOM Discussion**: Common pain point worth addressing explicitly

## Implementation Details

**Planned Content Structure Changes:**

1. **Enhanced Call-to-Action Slide**:

   - Replace shortened URLs with descriptive links
   - Add clearer action items for audience
   - Possibly separate from "Thank you!" slide

2. **New Dedicated Slide: "Framework Components â‰  Web Components"**:

   - Extract from current problems list in `presentation/pages/07-problems.md`
   - Create standalone slide explaining this crucial distinction
   - Position strategically in presentation flow

3. **Strengthen Problem Statement**:

   - Enhance `presentation/pages/05-big-question.md`
   - Make SuperTokens' specific challenge more explicit
   - Better connect to web components solution

4. **Consider Shadow DOM Discussion Slide**:
   - Add slide addressing common Shadow DOM pain points
   - Position after web components introduction
