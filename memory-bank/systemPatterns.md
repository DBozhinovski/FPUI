## Coding Patterns

- **SliDev Presentation Structure**: Markdown-based slides with frontmatter configuration
- **Web Component Architecture**: SolidJS-based components compiled to standard web components
- **Demo Organization**: Progressive complexity from basic usage to advanced integration patterns

## Architectural Patterns

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between presentation layer and implementation layer
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Demos build from simple concepts to complex integrations
- **Framework Agnostic**: Web components designed to work across different frontend frameworks

## Testing Patterns

- **Live Demo Integration**: Embedded demos within presentation slides for immediate validation
- **Multi-Framework Testing**: React integration demo validates cross-framework compatibility
- **Incremental Complexity**: Each demo builds on previous concepts for educational progression
