# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.
2025-05-24 22:32:52 - Log of updates made.

## Current Focus

- **Initial Project Analysis**: Understanding the structure and content of the SliDev presentation about SuperTokens R&D web components experiment
- **Preparation for Feedback Integration**: Getting ready to review and incorporate feedback on the presentation
- **Context Establishment**: Building comprehensive understanding of the presentation's narrative, technical content, and demo implementations

## Recent Changes

- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Created memory bank system to track project context and progress
- **Project Structure Analysis**: Identified two main components - presentation layer (SliDev) and implementation layer (solid-web-components)

## Open Questions/Issues

- **Pending Feedback Review**: User mentioned receiving feedback on the presentation that needs to be addressed
- **Feedback Scope**: Need to understand what specific aspects of the presentation the feedback addresses
- **Implementation vs Presentation**: Determine if feedback relates to presentation content, technical implementation, or both

## Presentation Analysis Complete

**2025-05-24 22:34:33** - Completed comprehensive analysis of the SliDev presentation structure and content.

### Key Findings:

- **Title**: "Future-proof your UI: Building with web components"
- **Narrative Arc**: Problem â†’ Solution â†’ Implementation â†’ Lessons Learned
- **Structure**: 25+ slides organized in weekly progression (Week 1-5 experiment timeline)
- **Core Problem**: SuperTokens needs framework-agnostic prebuilt UI but team prefers React/JSX
- **Solution Explored**: Web components built with SolidJS for better DX while maintaining framework agnosticism
- **Implementation Pattern**: Chat â†’ Code â†’ Demo for each weekly milestone

### Presentation Flow:

1. **Setup** (Slides 0-5): Title, confession, context, SuperTokens integration challenge, big question
2. **Foundation** (Slides 6-8): Web components 101, problems with vanilla WC APIs, practical issues
3. **Weekly Experiments** (Slides 9-24):
   - Week 1: Basic setup and demo
   - Week 2: Props & slots implementation
   - Week 3: Event handling
   - Week 5: React integration
4. **Conclusion** (Slide 25): Takeaways and good use cases

### Technical Components:

- **SliDev presentation** with custom styling and embedded demos
- **solid-web-components** implementation using SolidJS
- **Progressive demos** from basic to React integration
- **Mermaid diagrams** for decision flow visualization

## Feedback Analysis & Action Plan

**2025-05-24 22:35:42** - Received comprehensive feedback from presentation delivery. Categorizing into actionable improvements.

### Feedback Categories:

**âœ… Positive Aspects to Maintain:**

- Good pacing (20-minute timeframe)
- Information density appropriate
- Educational value (audience learned about web components)
- Code highlighting technique effective

**ðŸŽ¯ Priority Improvements:**

**1. Visual Design & Readability**

- Enlarge text and headings on slides with excessive negative space
- Improve code contrast for better readability
- Enhance chat bubble contrast (white on orange issue)
- Make architectural chart elements larger/use logos
- Mark non-essential code more obviously

**2. Content Structure & Clarity**

- Add clear call to action (GitHub repo, conversation starter)
- Make "framework components â‰  web components" more prominent (dedicated slide)
- Clarify problem statement in introduction
- Consider Shadow DOM discussion (common pain point)
- Break into more slides for better pacing

**3. Demo Enhancement**

- Extend demo duration for better point conveyance
- Step-by-step text revelation instead of all-at-once

**4. Presentation Flow**

- Mention speaker corner explicitly
- Better signposting between sections
