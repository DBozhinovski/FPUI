**Content Structure Enhancements:**

- [x] Add clear call-to-action slide with GitHub repo links (rephrased descriptions and added explicit CTA on `presentation/pages/25-takeaways.md`)
- [x] Create dedicated slide for "Framework Components â‰  Web Components" (created `presentation/pages/06b-framework-vs-web-components.md` and updated `slides.md`)
- [x] Strengthen problem statement in introduction slides (updated `presentation/pages/05-big-question.md`)
- [x] Consider adding Shadow DOM discussion slide (created `presentation/pages/06c-shadow-dom-challenges.md` and updated `slides.md`)

- [ ] Improve signposting between sections

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Visual design fixes (text size, contrast, readability)
2. **Phase 2**: Content structure improvements (new slides, reorganization)
3. **Phase 3**: Demo and flow enhancements
