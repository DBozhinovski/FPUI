# Solid Web Components

## Agenda

> AKA How Darko got bombarded with all sorts of questions by the engineering team,
> and the solutions he came up with

- Simple component
- Component with props (attribute$$s)
- Component with slots (children props)
- Component with event handlers
- Full component with internal state
- Using the Solid-built web component in a React app

---

### If we have time:

- Signals and Solid-specific features; Sharing state (and signal "exposure")
- SSR
- An actual implementation using SuperTokens (Dragons be there tho... don't judge me too much ðŸ¤£).
